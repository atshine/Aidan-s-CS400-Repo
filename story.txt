There lived a girl, in a not too big town, in a not too small apartment, who was plagued with a not too important decision: what to have for dinner. She knew it wasn't that big of a deal—she had often faced with this decision before—but there was something about this particular day of this particular week that was making her indecisiveness come into full effect. She pondered the possible meals she could eat...
She could make lasagna, chicken and rice, a pizza, or mac and cheese. None of these meals were particularly fancy. They were not too bland and not too tasty. As she pondered her choices, she realized that she could also order food from a restaurant. This was a new decision that she was to make. All the restaurants around her were not too amazing and not too terrible. She had to decide what type of cuisine she was interested in...
Having already spent half an hour pondering all the different meals she could make, the girl spent another half hour pondering all the restaraunts she could order from. Even after all that time, the girl could not make a decision. When she realized that she had wasted a whole hour without even making a decision, she decided that she had to take action. She knew that she needed to eat quickly and did not have time to cook because she needed to get other things done. With this in mind, she settled for frozen pizza because she knew that she could make it quickly and focus on other tasks while it was in the oven. Having finally made her decision, the girl preheated the oven and the carried on with her life.
